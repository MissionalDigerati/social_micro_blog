Social Micro Blog
=================

A blogging engine powered by your social media.  The blog displays posts from your favorite social media in a blog style.  All social network data is pulled in by triggering a Rake task as a cron job, so you do not need to worry about the speed of the website.  There is no content management in this software.  The content is managed purely from your social network sites.
